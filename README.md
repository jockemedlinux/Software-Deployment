# Software Deployment
Anything software deployment. Be it iPXE, MDT, WDS, FOG, or anything else.
This repository serves as a personal collection of notes, scripts, and resources related to software deployment using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT), along with insights on user interface (UI) development and integration with iPXE and Windows Deployment Services (WDS). While not a formal development repository, it contains valuable information and tools that I find interesting or worthwhile in my daily work.
